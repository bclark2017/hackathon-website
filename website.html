		<p><strong>HackToTheFuture</strong> is a hackathon for high schoolers of all progamming abilities. It's completely free and equipped with hardware for hacking, fantastic prizes, delicious food (meals provided!) and mentors to help you build your project. It's <strong>Saturday, December 19th</strong> in the Francis Parker School Library.</p>
		<p><strong>What is a hackathon?</strong> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a> is an engineering and coding event where students collaborate to build or program an entire project in a relatively short amount of time. Come with a team of friends, or create a team at the event and make new friends. No programming experience? Our students and mentors can help you get started at the event. HackToTheFuture and <a href="http://www.team2485.org">Team 2485</a>'s mission is to spread the love of programming and innovation while cultivating high schoolers' creativity to leave an impact on the system of education.</p>

		<h4>What is the theme?</h4>
		<p>This year's theme is education for the modern world. To help solve this problem, you can create anything from an app to a website to a robot.</p>
		<h4>Who can attend?</h4>
		<p>Anyone currently enrolled in high school may attend. If you're unsure about your eligibility, please contact us by email.</p>
		<h4>What if I have no programming experience?</h4>
		<p>No problem! HackToTheFuture is a great way to learn, thanks to our mentors, volunteers, and start-guide.</p>
		<h4>What do I bring?</h4>
		<p>Bring a laptop and charger (laptops cannot be provided, so we recommend bringing your own), the signed waiver (which will be sent out in an email before the event), and anything else you want to use to hack. A light breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided free, so you won't need to bring any meals.</p>
		<h4>Do I need a team for HackToTheFuture?</h4>
		<p>You can certainly come to the event with a team (up to 4 students), but you don't need one! Just make sure you arrive earlier so we can help you find a team.</p>
		<h4>How does judging work?</h4>
		<p>You will have the chance to present your project and get feedback from a panel of judges. During the deliberation process, you'll be able to exhibit your project and visit other projects in an all-participant expo. Projects will be judged based on originality, design, execution, and relation to the theme.</p>
		<h4>What are the rules for projects at HackToTheFuture?</h4>
		<p>To be eligible for judging, your project should be your own work! A project can be made using whatever technology you like, as long as you are able to present a working demonstration You may use premade general code libraries (we will also provide some), but you will only be judged based on what you create at HackToTheFuture. Contact us if you're still unsure about what is allowed.</p>
