		<h4>What do I bring?</h4>
		<p>Bring a laptop and charger (laptops will be provided but we recommend bringing your own), the signed waiver (which will be sent out in an email before the event), and anything else you want to use to hack. All meals and snacks are provided free, so you won't need to bring any.</p>

		<p>Nope! just make sure you arrive earlier so we can help you find a team.</p>

		<p>You will have the chance to present your project and get feedback from a panel of professionals. During the deliberation process, you'll be able to exhibit your project and visit other projects in an all-participant expo. Projects will be judged based on originality, design, execution, and relation to the theme.</p>

		<p>To be eligible for judging, your project should be your own work! A project can be made using whatever technology you like, as long as you are able to present a working demonstration You may use premade general code libraries (we will also provide some), but you will only be judged based on what you create at HackToTheFuture.
